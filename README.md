## Building the sample app

1. Clone this repository and open the project in XCode.
2. Optionally adjust the hardcoded variables in `PersonaViewController` to reflect your implementation details.
3. Run the project to test on a simulated device. To use a physical device, you will need to sign in with an Apple ID, enable Developer Mode on your device, and connect it with your Mac. See the instructions [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device#Connect-real-devices-to-your-Mac).
